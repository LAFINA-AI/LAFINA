This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

### Now what?

# LAFINA Backend (FastAPI & PostgreSQL)

LAFINA includes an offline-first FastAPI backend providing cloud account authentication, PostgreSQL synchronization, and DeepSeek-V4 Flash online assistant proxying.

## Backend Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- PostgreSQL database (optional for local testing; SQLite in-memory fallback is used during pytest)

## 1. Install Backend Dependencies
From the repository root:
```sh
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

## 2. Environment Variables & Production Deployment
Create a `.env` file in the root directory (or inside `backend/`):
```env
ENVIRONMENT=development
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/lafina
JWT_ISSUER=lafina-auth
JWT_AUDIENCE=lafina-app
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-your-deepseek-api-key
```
*(Note: If RS256 RSA keys are omitted in development, temporary keys are generated automatically on startup).*

### DeepSeek API Key Production Setup (Render)
1. **Generate Key**: Create an API key through the official [DeepSeek Platform](https://platform.deepseek.com/).
2. **Configure Environment Secret**: In your Render dashboard, navigate to Environment Variables and add `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` as a secret environment variable.
3. **Set Production Mode**: Set `ENVIRONMENT=production`. When `ENVIRONMENT=production`, backend startup will fail fast if `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` is missing or set to a placeholder value.
4. **Client Security Standard**: **NEVER** place the DeepSeek API key in React Native client configuration, source control, screenshots, logs, or client requests. The mobile app communicates strictly with the FastAPI `/v1/ai/chat` endpoint and never sees or receives provider credentials.
5. **Key Rotation Procedure**:
   - Create a new key on the DeepSeek Platform.
   - Update the `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` secret environment variable in Render.
   - Redeploy the web service successfully.
   - Revoke the previous key on the DeepSeek Platform.


## 3. Creating Admin Accounts (No Hardcoded Credentials)
To create an admin account or promote an existing account without hardcoding passwords:

**Option A: Using the Secure Admin CLI (Interactive Prompt)**
```sh
python -m backend.scripts.create_admin
```
*(Prompts interactively for `admin email` and `password` without storing or echoing them).*

**Option B: Via Environment Variables in `.env`**
```env
ADMIN_EMAIL=youradmin@domain.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-min-15-char-password
```

## 4. Database Migrations (PostgreSQL)
Run Alembic migrations to apply PostgreSQL table schemas and Row-Level Security (RLS) policies:
```sh
python -m alembic -c backend/alembic.ini upgrade head
```

## 5. Run Development Server
Start FastAPI server with auto-reload:
```sh
python -m uvicorn backend.app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```
- **OpenAPI Interactive Docs**: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
- **SQLAdmin Studio (Secure Admin UI)**: [http://localhost:8000/admin](http://localhost:8000/admin) (Requires logging in with an active account having `role == "admin"`).

## 6. Run Backend Tests & Linting
Run the Pytest suite (covers Auth, RS256 JWT, Argon2id, Sync LWW ordering, and DeepSeek proxy):
```sh
python -m pytest backend/tests
```

Run Ruff linter check:
```sh
python -m ruff check backend
```
