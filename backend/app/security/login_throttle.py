"""Slowing down password guessing at sign-in.

Every failed sign-in is written to ``security_events``, keyed by a hash of the
email it was for, whether or not that account exists: the limit then behaves
the same for real and made-up addresses, so it cannot be used to find out who
has an account. The raw email is never stored.

Once an email has ``MAX_LOGIN_FAILURES_PER_15MIN`` failures inside the window,
sign-in for it is refused until the oldest of them ages out, even with the
right password. Otherwise the limit would only slow a guesser down, not stop
one. The count is kept in the database rather than in memory so it survives a
restart or a redeploy and holds across server instances.
