"""Turning a meeting transcript into structured meeting notes.

The transcript is produced on the user's laptop by Whisper; only its text ever
reaches this server, and from here only the text reaches DeepSeek.

Long meetings are summarised hierarchically. The desktop app cuts the transcript
into sections, each section is turned into partial notes, and the partial notes
are consolidated into the final set. Keeping the intermediate step as
*structured notes* rather than free prose is deliberate: a decision or an
action item stays a decision or an action item on its way up, instead of being
paraphrased into a sentence the final pass has to rediscover.

The prompts say, repeatedly, not to invent. The parser backs that up: an owner
or a deadline the model could only have guessed — "Unassigned", "TBD", "N/A" —
is stored as empty, which is what the transcript actually said.
