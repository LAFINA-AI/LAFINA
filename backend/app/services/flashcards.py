"""Turning document text into a deck of flashcards.

The model is asked for a bare JSON array and told, in as many words, not to
wrap it in anything. It sometimes does anyway — a fenced code block, a
"Here are your flashcards:" line, an object with the array inside it — so the
parser here treats the reply as untrusted text that probably contains JSON
rather than as JSON. A deck is worth salvaging; a 502 over a stray fence is
not.
